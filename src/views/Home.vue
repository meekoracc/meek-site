      The name's Meeko, I'm a 28 year old CS PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a goddamn furry! I made this site to share the art that I recieve, maybe blog a little bit, share furry-related projects I'm working on, and just generally give myself a space to be fucked up without handing it over to Twitter.
      I'll be slowly (very slowly) updating this site to be more reactive, pretty, and full of content.
      Who knows? Maybe I'll be able to monetize it at some point so I won't have to live the life of a starving student... but probably not.
